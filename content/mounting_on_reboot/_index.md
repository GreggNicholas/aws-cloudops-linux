# Mount an attached volume after reboot

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll mount the Amazon EBS volume you've configured previously on every system reboot.

Follow "Automatically mount an attached volume after reboot" using [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-using-volumes.html). In order to connect to your EC2 instance via SSH, follow the _Logging In_ section.
 
Once you have finished without errors, reboot the instance following [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-reboot.html) and post your status to [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xxHMJ_m2R-VvTCkJWQvTv6I2geRETGq9m9ezoIEyBxw/edit?usp=sharing). 
Continue to the next step.
