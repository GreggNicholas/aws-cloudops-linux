## Amazon CloudOps Linux Workshop

In this workshop, we will walk through the fundamentals of Linux server administration as a part of the AWS Cloud Operations course.
By the end of this two-session module, you will be able to perform basic Linux and AWS administration tasks as a preparation for the
following AWS Cloud Administrator bootcamp. Depending on your level of experience, you may want to have a look at the [Further Reading](/further_reading.html)
